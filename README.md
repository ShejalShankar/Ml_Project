Introduction
Lane Detection is a task in Computer Vision and an important component of Autonomous Vehicles and Advanced Drivers Assistance system.In this project I have used semantic segmentation techniques to identify the boundaries of lane markings. The Dataset used is the TUSimple dataset which consists of 6408 images of US highway road scenes.
