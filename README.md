#Introduction
##Lane Detection using Semantic Segmentation and U-Net 
Lane Detection is a task in Computer Vision and an important component of Autonomous Vehicles and Advanced Drivers Assistance system.In this project I have used semantic segmentation techniques to identify the boundaries of lane markings. The Dataset used is the TUSimple dataset which consists of 6408 images of US highway road scenes.The resolution of image is 1280Ã—720. The dataset is composed of 3,626 for training, 358 for validation, and 2,782 for testing called the TuSimple test set of which the images are under different weather conditions.
